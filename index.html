             Do you ever wonder why some teams seem more efficient and effective than others? High performing teams have discovered the role that temperament plays in team performance. They have learned to deploy in the areas of their strengths and accomadate for each other's weaknesses. How do they do that? They know their team and they value their differences. They're not surprised by the conflict their uniqueness generates but have learned to leverage it to build a stronger team. Utilizing the DISC temperament tool, Jan and Rhonda will help you discover your unique contribution to your team. They will also teach you how to change your leadership speak and conflict management style to most effectively relate to each team member's particular temperament.

              Without strong leadership, even the best teams will falter. Mastering the art of “self-leadership” is critical for both individual success and creating winning teams. However, most people find it easier to direct others rather than do the difficult work of self-reflection that will ultimately propel the whole team towards greatness. </br> </br>

              The two speakers will guide you through a series of “self-leadership” questions that will help ensure you are giving the best possible gift you can give your team– a fully focused, deeply passionate and highly energized you. Those who commit to the rewarding work of self-leadership are then uniquely positioned to excel at one of the leader’s greatest responsibilities: replication. In this session you will learn how to identify and cultivate the leadership potential in others. You will also gain insight into how casting a compelling vision for a “leadership culture” will motivate, activate and ultimately transform your team.

              All teams go through seasons of stagnation and conflict; members of a team need to understand that this is normal in order for the team not to get derailed. Healthy teams proactively identify and address the barriers they face.

They will also discover how TeamSTEPPS tools and concepts are the keys to unlocking the team’s higher goal, propelling their team into a place of strength and effectiveness once again.
